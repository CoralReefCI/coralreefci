### Build well

## Description

This is the internal, private repository containing all relevant code for
the **CoralReefCI** software suite. Various subdirectories will be made
available for open source use deemed possible and will be established on
a case-by-case basis. Otherwise the code here is proprietary in nature and
should be treated as such.  

Code hosted on **GitHub** is the primary code base for the project.
