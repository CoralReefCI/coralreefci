# CoralReefCI&trade; Training and Benchmark Data

## Description

Data for use in training and validating the machine learning model will be
stored in this directory.  

## Benchmark

This data will be primarily used by the model as a means for generating
**"industry standard"**-measurable output. Most work in machine
learning-powered utilizes Eclipse bug data as a primary data source when
evaluating their model outputs.  

## Training

Data for use in training the machine learning model will likely come from
either a a **dynamically** generated process or from a variety of **static**
issue collections.  

- **Dynamic**: a process at program runtime will pull in the necessary data
for the model to train off of from the target repository.  
- **Static**: various selected public project issue lists (e.g. **.NET**).  

## Notes

Currently only **.NET** issues are featured as the *static training* set.

## Model Output

*# Output with accuracy and success rates will be put here*  
*# Copy and paste from the command line output*
