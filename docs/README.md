### Machine learning-powered contributor integration

## Overview

**CoralReefCI** is a service for GitHub-hosted projects that maps newly raised
issues to contributors so that project managers and members can focus on
building the highest quality code possible.  

## Name

**CoralReefCI** (pronounced "SEE-eye") takes its name from the great coral
reefs of our planet and was inspired by the natural beauty, organic growth, and
seamless integration of countless species into their ecosystem.  

## Description

The bulk of the codebase is written in the **Go** language which was chosen
for its industrial-strength performance and artistic simplicity. Currently,
the service is geared towards GitHub-hosted projects but ultimately plans on
expanding to other code hosting services once the infrastructure is mature.  

A variety of machine learning approaches and models power the backend of the
service to build contributor profiles, optimize production timelines, and
continually learn from the target repository.  

## Contributing

Contributions and community involvement is welcome for all of the public
CoralReefCI repositories. Please see the guidelines in **CONTRIBUTING.md**.  

Note that contributions are not merely limited to the code base and could
include things such as instruction manuals, walkthroughs, documentation,
feature ideas, issue handling, community discussions, etc.
