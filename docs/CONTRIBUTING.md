# Contributing to CoralReefCI&trade;

Welcome to **CoralReefCI**!  

We welcome any and all constructive contributions to our public repositories.
Below are several guidelines on how to best contribute to the project.  

## Reporting issues

Issues and are accepted exclusively through GitHub. Please keep your
descriptions clear and comprehensive enough for rapid review and collaborative
discussions.  

## Code guidelines

We believe that code shouldn't just be *functional*, it should be *beautiful*.
As such, we take great lengths to ensure that we provide our community with
rich, well-designed repositories to contribute to.  

Additionally, we believe that code should be **self documenting** in that
naming and writing conventions should be understandable with *minimal* in-code
documentation and comments.  

If comments are necessary, please use `// DOC: Comments go here.` as the
style.  

Lastly, all changes should pass `gofmt` (for uniformity) and unit tests with
`go test` (conforming to TDD).  

## Commit messages

For clarity, follow [these guidelines](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
with regards to writing your commit messages. Include a title sentence using
the imperative tense, followed by a description with details and notes with any
pertinent information.

## Contributing

All contributors must sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/) prior to having
any changes included in the project.
