# Contributing to CoralReefCI&trade;

Welcome to **CoralReefCI**!  

We welcome any and all constructive contributions to our public repositories.
Below are several guidelines on how to best contribute to the project.

## Reporting issues

- via GitHub
- example issue

## Code guidelines

We believe that code shouldn't just be *functional*, it should be *beautiful*.
As such, we take great lengths to ensure that we provide our community with
rich, well-designed repositories to contribute to.

Some guidelines we require all submitted code to adhere to are:
- all code must follow official Go-styled formatting
  - running `gofmt -w filename.go` on all changed files is recommended
- new functionality should be reflected in testing files
  - internally we follow a TDD process and encourage our community to do so as
  well
- adjust documentation as it is required; not too much, not too little
  - refer to examples of in-code documentation for guidance
- all contributors must sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/)
  - pull requests will not be accepted unless the CLA is completed
- include relevant issue numbers (if available)
  - this makes tracking progress easier for everyone involved
