# Heupr&trade; Developer Selection Logic

- Things to consider:
  - how recently last contributed to project
  - how many times contributed overall
  - current milestones of the GitHub repository
  - dates of current milestones
  - space between prior contributions
  - currently assigned issues
  - average time to completion of assignments

- Settings:
  - strictness of activity level (recent contributions)
  - availability overrides
  - milestone requirements / timeframes
    - "squeezing" more issues into milestones than is recommended
    - creating additional milestones

- Flow:
  - newly raised issue is fed into the model (in this case Bhattacharya)
  - model generates possible candidates to fix the issue
  - candidates are examined for currently open issues
