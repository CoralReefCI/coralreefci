      Q: What are "default" and "dynamic" labels?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Great question! "Default" labels are ones you want applied to
      <i>every</i> incoming issue whereas "dynamic" are the ones Heupr
      chooses from and selects the one with the <i>best fit</i>.

      Q: What data do you use for training?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Heupr uses prior issue assignments and issue text fields to
      ascertain the best contributors to handle the issue and which
      labels best define the issue. Currently, we only use
      <i>public</i> data.
