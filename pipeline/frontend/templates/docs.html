      Q: What are "default" and "classification" labels?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Great question! "Default" labels are ones you want applied to
      <i>every</i> incoming issue while "classification" are the ones you want
      Heupr to use to identify <i>bug</i>/<i>improvement</i>/<i>feature</i>
      issues.

      Q: What are "default" and "dynamic" labels?
    </p>

      <i>every</i> incoming issue whereas "dynamic" are the ones Heupr
      chooses from and selects the one with the <i>best fit</i>.

      Q: Why I don't see assignments and/or labels on a new issue?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Heupr may have hit a GitHub rate limit - if you don't see an update
      by then, try refreshing the issue page. If that doesn't work, give us a
      shout and we'll look right into it!

      Q: What data do you use for training?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Heupr uses prior issue assignments and issue text fields to
      ascertain the best contributors to handle the issue and which
      labels best define the issue. Currently, we only use
      <i>public</i> data.

      Q: Where does the name "Heupr" come from?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It's a portmanteau of the words "heuristic" and "projects"
      (together pronounced "HUE-per") and is a reminder of our goal to help
      people <i><b>make smart projects</b></i>!
