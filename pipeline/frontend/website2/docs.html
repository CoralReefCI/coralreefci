      <h4>User workflow</h4>
        <p>
          In order to install Heupr on your repo, click the "SIGN UP NOW!"
          button on the website landing page. You'll be redirected to sign in
          via GitHub and then presented with a list of repos you have access to
          install the app on.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this, you'll be redirected to a user authentication page also
          through GitHub. This is necessary in order to retrieve information on
          which repos you have access to make console settings changes to. You
          will also need to do this each time you'd like to make a settings
          change to any of the repos you have Heupr installed on (it's our
          current way to ensure security).
        </p>
        <p>
          From that you'll be sent to a page to make your selection of which
          repo you'd like to make settings changes to. The list will be all
          repos you have access to that currently have Heupr installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you choose a repo, you'll be presented with a console page. This
          contains settings for how labels are placed on your repo's issues.
          There is a section for "default" labels, which are added to every
          incoming issue, and a section for user-defined "buckets." These
          "buckets" (e.g. "os") should each have a unique name and whichever
          labels best fit go in them (e.g. "linux", "macOS", "windows"). Once
          you hit "Submit", your settings will be sent to Heupr which will
          apply them to all new issues!
        </p>
