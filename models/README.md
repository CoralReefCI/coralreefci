# CoralReefCI&trade; Models

## Description

All back-end logic powering the CoralReefCI&trade; project is stored in
this directory. Each model is separated into a unique directory which
contains *action-items*, *code*, and *resources* folders.

- **Action-items**:
  - Curated list of actionable items generated from resources
  - This is then put into a project organization tool (e.g. blossom.io)
- **Code**:
  - Working project code that is functional and deployable
- **Resources**:
  - Third-party research and resources
  - Also could be self-generated unique research pieces
