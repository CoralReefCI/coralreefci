# Bhattacharya Model

## Description

This model takes its name from the scholarly article by
**Bhattacharya et al.** on which the bulk of the initial model structure is
built. The primary features of this particular model include a Naive Bayes
classifier, tossing graphs, and incremental learning among others.

## Notes

The code here will be a refactored version of the model that was previously
built.
