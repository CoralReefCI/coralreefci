# CoralReefCI&trade; Performance Analysis

## Description

This directory contains the various **testing structures** necessary for the
CoralReefCI project. These will include several types such as model
backtesting, stress testing infrastructure, handling failure scenarios, and
others (as they are developed).  

All of the results from these tests are being output as files into the data/
directory. Note that this directory focuses on a cmd/ directory that houses
all of the subdirectories clustered as individual `main` packages holding the
necessary executables to fire the desired test packets.  

Think of this directory as containing "model-level" or "project-level" unit
tests.
